**1. What are the four tags required in every HTML page?**

In every HTML page, there are four fundamental tags that play key roles:

1. `<!DOCTYPE>`: This declaration tag specifies the document type and HTML version, ensuring proper rendering at the beginning of an HTML document.

2. `<html>`: Serving as the root element, the `<html>` tag encapsulates all other elements within an HTML document.

3. `<head>`: The `<head>` element stores document metadata, including the page title, character set, and links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts.

4. `<body>`: The `<body>` element houses the primary content of the web page, encompassing text, images, links, and visible elements for the user.

**2. What is HTML emojis tags and write simple program to disply some emojis?**

 Certainly, here's a rewritten version:

To include HTML emojis, you can use either Unicode characters or emoji entities. Emoji entities are a method for representing emojis using their corresponding Unicode code points. Below, you'll find a simple HTML program that showcases various emojis using emoji entities:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Emoji Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>HTML Emoji Example</h1>
    <p>This is a heart emoji: &#128153;</p>
    <p>Here's a thumbs-up: &#128077;</p>
    <p>This is a smiling emoji: &#128516;</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**3. Make a personal web. Type a few paragraphs to introduce yourself to the world and use the HTML tags youâ€™ve learned in this Experiment to make them into a web page.**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Ahmed Waleed's Personal Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to Ahmed Waleed's Personal Web Page</h1>
